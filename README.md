# Project React testing library - RTL
## _Application forehead_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/findCarolinaCosta/project-react-testing-library) No deploy since I only did the tests

In this project text if the application works as it should.

- ✨Good ✨

## Tech Infos

In RTL the following technologies are used:

- [REACTJS](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) - CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.
- [JAVASCRIPT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript) - JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.
- [RTL](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - React Testing Library builds on top of DOM Testing Library by adding APIs for working with React components.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/es-ES/docs/testing-frameworks) - Testing Web Frameworks.

## Installation and test

Recipes app requires [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6+ to run.

Make a git clone of the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/findCarolinaCosta/project-trivia-react-redux.git
```

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd project-recipes-app
npm install
npm start (To see the application)
```

### Unit tests ...
List of files where I did the tests:
1. Test done on the component <App.js />
2. Test done on the component <About.js />
3. Test done on the component <FavoritePokemons.js />
4. Test done on the component <NotFound.js />
5. Test done on the component <Pokedex.js />
6. Test done on the component <Pokemon.js />
7. Test done on the component <PokemonDetails.js />

Command for jest unit testing:
```
npm test
Press a to run all tests
```

### Check test coverage (Configuration done by [Trybe](https://github.com/tryber)):
- For each requirement
List of requirements/commands:
1. Test the component <App.js />  ```npx stryker run ./stryker/App.conf.json```
   
2. Test the component <About.js />  ```npx stryker run ./stryker/About.conf.json```

3. Test the component <FavoritePokemons.js /> ```npx stryker run ./stryker/FavoritePokemons.conf.json```
   
4. Test the component <NotFound.js /> ```npx stryker run ./stryker/NotFound.conf.json```
   
5. Test the component <Pokedex.js /> ```npx stryker run ./stryker/Pokedex.conf.json```
   
6. Test the component <Pokemon.js /> ```npx stryker run ./stryker/Pokemon.conf.json```
   
7. Test the component <PokemonDetails.js /> ```npx stryker run ./stryker/PokemonDetails.conf.json```

Observation: When failure occurs when unit tests do not cover 100% of use cases generated by Stryker. Stryker displays the error it injected into the test to test a use case. Which means this bug wasn't covered by his test, so it's in the #survived column.

## Project report
Very enriching project, in it I put into practice what I learned about jest, unit tests, how to test in react applications with the react testing library. And I learned that it is possible to create a test for unit tests, for example to check the coverage of tests within the application. What was amazing!
